## Taxi-v3 Environment: Understanding States, Actions, and Q-learning

### States:

1. **Taxi Location:**  
Situated within a 5x5 grid, the Taxi can find itself in any one of:
   - 5 x 5 = 25 distinct locations.

2. **Passenger Location:**  
A passenger's position is defined as:
   - One of 4 specific pick-up points: `R`, `G`, `Y`, `B`.
   - Or being inside the taxi. 
   
   Hence, a total of 5 potential passenger locations exist.

3. **Destination Location:**  
A passenger aims to reach one of the 4 drop-off spots:
   - `R`, `G`, `Y`, `B`.

Considering the components mentioned above, the environment has:
- Taxi locations (25) multiplied by Passenger locations (5) and then by Destination locations (4) 
- Resulting in 500 unique states.

### Actions:

The taxi's set of actions include:

1. Navigate South
2. Head North
3. Venture East
4. Proceed West
5. Engage passenger pick-up
6. Execute passenger drop-off

Summing up, the taxi has 6 actions at its disposal.

### Code Description:

The presented code offers a robust illustration of training an intelligent agent using the Q-learning technique on the Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI Gym. 

- **Initialization**: The Taxi-v3 environment is initialized.
- **Q-learning Function**: The function `qlearn()` trains an agent over 1000 episodes, adjusting its Q-values based on rewards and encouraging exploratory behavior using noise.
   - `gamma`: It's the discount factor determining the present value of future rewards.
   - The Q-table is initialized with zero values.
   - The function returns the optimized Q-table post training.
- **Visualization**: Post-training, the agent's competence is exhibited in the Taxi-v3 environment using the learned Q-values, allowing one to witness how effectively the taxi picks up and drops off passengers based on its training.
