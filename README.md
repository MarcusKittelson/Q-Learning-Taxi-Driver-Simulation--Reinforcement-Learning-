## Taxi-v3 Environment: States and Actions Breakdown

### States:

1. **Taxi Location:**  
The grid world for the Taxi-v3 environment is a 5x5 layout. Therefore, the taxi can be in one of:
   - 5 x 5 = 25 possible locations.

2. **Passenger Location:**  
The passenger can be in any of these positions:
   - At one of 4 distinct locations: `R`, `G`, `Y`, `B`.
   - Inside the taxi. 
   
   This sums up to 5 possible passenger locations.

3. **Destination Location:**  
The passenger's destination can be one of 4 distinct locations:
   - `R`, `G`, `Y`, `B`.

Given the above components, the total number of states is calculated as:
- Taxi locations (25) x Passenger locations (5) x Destination locations (4) 
- = 25 x 5 x 4 
- = 500 states.

### Actions:

The taxi can perform the following actions:

1. Move South
2. Move North
3. Move East
4. Move West
5. Pickup the passenger
